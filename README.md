# Starbucks-Application
Practicing with mongo node and express

messing with a CSV file that contains all starbucks locations in the world 

1.clean js transforms csv file to a json file then imports json data into mongodb 
2.index html asks client for longitude and latitude that will find the nearest starbuck according to the region.
  Added a feature that uses express method that gets clients latitude and longitude based through a html element event handler.
3.app.js gets the closest latitude and longitude and responses with a generated html page that shows the starbucks information
